# .NET CLI Context for LLMs

## Orientation

You are interacting with the .NET SDK CLI. This document provides context for effective tool use.

## Version Guidance

- Target .NET 10 (LTS) for new projects
- .NET 10 uses C# 14
- Use Microsoft.Extensions.AI for AI integration
- Prefer modern patterns: top-level statements, primary constructors, collection expressions
- Latest release information is available via `dotnet skill release`

## Skills

The .NET CLI exposes skills via `dotnet skill`. Each skill is a terse document that describes how to perform a specific task.

For example, to learn how to query .NET docs, use `dotnet skill docs`. 

### Skill commands 
- `dotnet skill list` — all available skills
- `dotnet skill <skill>` — Print the skill to `stdout`

## Key Skills for Agents

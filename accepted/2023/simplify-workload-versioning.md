# Simplify Workload Versioning

.NET SDK Workloads are optional components of the .NET SDK.  When designing workloads, one of the goals was to be able to update workloads separately from the .NET SDK.  As a result, workloads version and update separately from the .NET SDK.  This has made it hard to understand what versions of workloads are installed or available.  Complicating this is the fact that workloads themselves don't directly have a version.  Workload manifests, which can have a many-to-many relationship with workloads, have versions.  These versions can be displayed with the `dotnet workload update --print-rollback` command, which displays output in the following format:

```
==workloadRollbackDefinitionJsonOutputStart==
{
  "microsoft.net.sdk.android": "33.0.26/7.0.100",
  "microsoft.net.sdk.ios": "16.2.1030/7.0.100",
  "microsoft.net.sdk.maccatalyst": "16.2.1030/7.0.100",
  "microsoft.net.sdk.macos": "13.1.1030/7.0.100",
  "microsoft.net.sdk.maui": "7.0.59/7.0.100",
  "microsoft.net.sdk.tvos": "16.1.1527/7.0.100",
  "microsoft.net.workload.mono.toolchain.net6": "7.0.3/7.0.100",
  "microsoft.net.workload.mono.toolchain.net7": "7.0.3/7.0.100",
  "microsoft.net.workload.emscripten.net6": "7.0.3/7.0.100",
  "microsoft.net.workload.emscripten.net7": "7.0.3/7.0.100"
}
==workloadRollbackDefinitionJsonOutputEnd==
```

This is very complicated and doesn't make it easy to understand workload versions.

## Goals

- Introduce a single version number that represents all workload versions for the the .NET SDK
- Workloads can continue to release outside the normal .NET SDK release schedule
- Deadlines for workload completion and insertion do not change from current processes
- Workload updates should require minimal (or no) additional validation of non-workload scenarios

## Workload sets

Currently, we use a 3 part version number for the .NET SDK, for example 8.0.100.  Typically we release a patch each month, for example 8.0.101, 8.0.102, etc.

We will create the concept of a "workload set" which has a version number that encapsulates all the workload manifest versions that are released together.  A workload set is essentially a mapping from the workload set version to the different versions for each workload manifest.  For public releases, the workload set version will use the same version number as the .NET SDK.  For example, when .NET SDK 8.0.101 releases, there will be a corresponding workload set version 8.0.101 that corresponds to the versions of the workloads that were released together with that .NET SDK.

## Interim workload set versions

For workload sets released between releases of the .NET SDK, we will use 4-part version numbers.  For example, workload set 8.0.203 would be released together with .NET SDK 8.0.203.  If we want to release another workload set before the 8.0.204 SDK release, then we can designate that workload set as 8.0.203.1 (and 8.0.203.2 if there's another interim workload set, etc.).  This is a departure from Semantic Versioning, but appears to be the best way to have an understandable version number for interim workload set releases.

Some examples of possible workload set versions:

- `8.0.203` - Regular monthly release
- `8.0.203.1` - Interim workload set release
- `8.0.204-preview.1` - Preview interim release of changes that are expected to be incuded in 8.0.204
- `8.0.203.1-preview.1` - Preview interim release of changes that are expected to be released in a workload set before 8.0.204
- `9.0.100-preview.2` - Workload set for .NET SDK preview release
- `8.0.201-servicing.23015` - Daily build of dotnet/workload-versions repo
- `8.0.201-ci.maui.23015` - Workload set corresponding to daily build of maui repo

## Baseline workload versions

.NET SDK workloads have similar shipping deadlines as the .NET SDK.  That means that the .NET SDK itself can't include final versions of workloads which are built outside of the .NET build, as building and signing off on those workloads happens in parallel with .NET build and signoff.  So the .NET SDK ships with *baseline* workload manifests, which are mainly used to enable the .NET SDK to list which workloads are available, and to know if a project requires a workload which isn't installed.  By default, when a workload is installed via the .NET CLI, the .NET SDK will first look for and update to the latest workload manifests for the current feature band before installing workloads.

When we build the .NET SDK, we will assign a workload set version to the baseline workload manifest versions that are included in that SDK.  For releases with stabilized version numbers, we need a different workload set version number for the baseline workload manifest versions than for the stabilized version number for the .NET SDK.  In that case, we will use `baseline` as a the first semantic version pre-release identifier, followed by build number information.  For example, the baseline workload set version for 8.0.201 could be `8.0.201-baseline.23919.2`.

There are various ways we could display this baseline workload set version number:

- `8.0.201-baseline.23919.2`
- `8.0.201-baseline`
- `8.0.201 (Baseline)`

For non-stabilized builds of the .NET SDK, we will use the same (prerelease) version number for the baseline workload set version as we do for the .NET SDK version.

QUESTION: Will it be OK for the `baseline` versions to be semantically less than `preview` and `rc` versions?

## Workload versions in Visual Studio

Visual Studio includes the .NET SDK, but rather than including baseline manifest versions for the .NET SDK workloads, it includes the final workload manifests for a given release.  These manifests are inserted into Visual Studio together with the workloads.

For public releases of Visual Studio, the workload set version information should be created and inserted into Visual Studio together with the workloads.  However, internal builds of Visual Studio may not have an assigned workload set version.  In that case, the .NET SDK will use the same basic logic as it currently does to select manifests.  This involves finding the latest installed manifest for the current feature band, and if an expected manifest isn't found for the current feature band, then falling back to previous feature bands.  In this case, when a workload set version is needed, the .NET SDK will create a version using the .NET SDK feature band, the pre-release specifier `manifests`, and a hash of the manifest IDs and versions.  For example, `8.0.200-manifests.9e7f4b93`.

## Experience

`dotnet --version` would continue to print the SDK version, as it does today:

```
> dotnet --version
8.0.201
```

We will add a new `dotnet workload --version` command to print the workload set version:

```
> dotnet workload --version
8.0.201
```

We will also update `dotnet --info` and `dotnet workload --info` to display the workload set version.  For example:

```
> dotnet --info
.NET SDK:
 Version:                 8.0.201
 Commit:                  <commit>
 Workload version:    8.0.201

<further information>

> dotnet workload --info
 Workload version:  8.0.201
 [wasm-tools]
   Installation Source: SDK 8.0.100-preview.4
   Manifest Version:    8.0.0-preview.4.23181.9/8.0.100-preview.4
   Manifest Path:       C:\git\dotnet-sdk-main\.dotnet\sdk-manifests\8.0.100-preview.4\microsoft.net.workload.mono.toolchain.current\WorkloadManifest.json
   Install Type:        FileBased
```

When updating workloads, console output will include the old and new workload set versions:

```
> dotnet workload install wasm-tools
Checking for updated workload set...
Updating workload set version from 8.0.201-baseline.23919.2 to 8.0.201...
Installing workload manifest microsoft.net.sdk.android version 34.0.0-preview.4.230...
<Further workload manifest update messages>
Installing pack Microsoft.NET.Runtime.WebAssembly.Sdk version 8.0.0-preview.4.23181.9...
<Further workload pack installation manifests>
Garbage collecting for SDK feature band(s) 8.0.200...

Successfully updated workload set version from 8.0.201-baseline.23919.2 to 8.0.201.
Successfully installed workload(s) wasm-tools.
```

The proposed [workload history](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/30486) command will also display the workload set versions.

The .NET SDK will periodically (once a day, by default) check for updated workload versions in order to notify users if there is an update available.  Currently, commands such as `dotnet build` print out the following message:

```
Workload updates are available. Run `dotnet workload list` for more information.
```

The `dotnet workload list` command, in turn, prints out the following message:

```
Updates are available for the following workload(s): wasm-tools. Run `dotnet workload update` to get the latest.
```

We will modify both commands to print the same message:

```
A workload update (version 8.0.202) is available. Run `dotnet workload update` to install the latest workloads.
```

We will add a new `--version` option to `dotnet workload update` to allow installing (or downgrading to) a specific workload set version:

```
> dotnet workload update --version 8.0.202
Updating workload set version from 8.0.201 to 8.0.202...
<Manifest and pack installation / garbage collection messages>
Successfully updated workload set version from 8.0.201 to 8.0.202.
```

## Specifying workload versions with global.json

We will add support for specifying the workload set version in global.json.  For example:

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "workloadVersion": "8.0.201"
  }
}
```

This would force the SDK to use workload set version `8.0.201`, and would error if that version was not installed.

NOTE: We may not implement the global.json workload set version support in the same release as the rest of the changes described in this design.

## Side by side workload sets

The workload `restore`, `update`, and `install` commands will be updated to check if there is a global.json file specifying a workload set version applying to the current folder.  If so, these commands will install that workload set version side-by-side with any other installed workload set.  They will also record the path to the global.json file and the workload set version it specified.  This record will be used as a root during garbage collection to prevent the side-by-side workload set (and its packs) from being removed.

The `dotnet workload clean` command will read these records and check to see if the global.json file referenced still exists and specifies the same workload set version.  If not, that record will be removed before garbage collection, allowing the workload set, its manifests, and packs to possibly be removed.  The `dotnet workload clean --all` command uninstalls all workloads, and will also delete all of these records.

Question: What should clean do if a path is not accessible (ie on a thumb drive that was removed)?

We will add a `dotnet workload roots` command (though hopefully we can come up with a better name).  This will list all of the current records of global.json paths and workload set versions that the SDK has.  This can help understand why workload assets may not be uninstalled / cleaned up as expected.

Question: Should we support `dotnet workload install --version`?  This could help in the scenario where you switch back and forth between branches that pin different workload set versions, but don't want the churn of uninstalling and reinstalling workloads each time.

## Workload list updates

`dotnet workload list` currently displays the workload ID, the manifest version, and the installation source.  We will change it to display the workload set version instead of the manifest version.  Additionally, we will add a column for the "status".  If all the packs for the workload are installed, this will be "OK".  If any packs are missing, the status will be "Missing packs".  This can happen if the workload set is updated to a new baseline workload set, or if there are side-by-side workload sets installed but a workload is not installed for all of those workload sets.

## Development build behavior

Currently, when the .NET SDK looks for workload updates, it looks for the latest available version of each individual manifest.  We will change this so that it will look for the latest "workload set version", which is a package that we create and publish.

However, for development builds of the .NET SDK, we may want to retain the old behavior of updating each manifest individually.  This would allow the latest workloads to be used with a development build even if they hadn't flowed into the installer build and we hadn't created a workload set version package.

We will add a `--update-manifests-separately` parameter to the `dotnet workload update` and `install` commands, which will opt in to the old update behavior.  We may also make this the default behavior for development builds, though there may not be a good way to tell whether a given build is a "development" build or a build that will be released as an official public preview.  If development builds aren't signed the same way as full preview builds are, we may be able to key off of that.

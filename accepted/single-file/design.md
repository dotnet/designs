# Single-file Publish

Design for publishing apps as a single-file in .Net Core 3.0

## Introduction

The goal of this effort is enable .Net-Core apps to be published and distributed as a single executable.

There are several strategies to implement this feature -- ranging from bundling the published files into zip file (ex: [Warp](https://github.com/dgiagio/warp)), to native compiling and linking all the binaries together (ex: [CoreRT](https://github.com/dotnet/corert)). These options, along with their cost/benefit analysis is explored in this [staging document](staging.md).

#### Goals

In .Net Core 3.0, we plan to implement a solution that 

* Is widely compatible: Apps containing MSIL assemblies, ready-to-run assemblies, native binaries, configuration files, etc. can be packaged into one executable.
* Can run framework dependent pure managed apps directly from bundle:
  * Executes IL assemblies, and processes configuration files directly from the bundled executable.
  * Extracts ready-to-run and native binaries to disk before loading them.
* Usable with debuggers and tools:  The single-file should be debuggable using the generated symbol file. It should also be usable with profilers and tools similar to a non-bundled app.

This feature-set is described as Stage 2 in the [staging document](staging.md), and can be improvised in further releases.

#### Non Goals

* Optimizing for development: The single-file publishing is typically not a part of the development cycle. It is typically used in release builds as a packaging step. Therefore, the single-file feature will be designed with focus on consumption rather than production.
* Merging IL: Tools like [ILMerge](https://github.com/dotnet/ILMerge) combines the IL from many assemblies into one, but lose assembly identity in the process. This is not a goal for single-file feature.

#### Existing tools

Single-file packaging for .Net Core apps is currently supported by third-party tools such as [Warp](https://github.com/dgiagio/warp) and [Costura](https://github.com/Fody/Costura). We now consider the pros and cons of implementing this feature within .Net Core.

##### Advantages

* A standardized experience available for all apps
* Integration with dotnet CLI
* A more transparent experience: for example, external tools may utilize public APIs such `AssemblyLoadContext.Resolving` or `AssemblyLoadContext.ResolvingUnmanagedDll` events to load files from a bundle. However, this may conflict with the app's own use of these APIs, which requires a cooperative resolution. Such a situation is avoided by providing inbuilt support for single-file apps.

##### Limitations

* Inbox implementation of the feature adds complexity for customers with respect to the list of deployment options to choose from.
* Independent tools can evolve faster on their own schedule.
* Independent tools can provide richer set of features catering to match a specific set of customers.

We believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages in with respect to implementing this feature inbox.

## Design

There are two main aspects to publishing apps as a self-extracting single file:

- The Bundler: A tool that embeds the managed app, its dependencies, and the runtime into a single host executable.
- The host: The "single-file" which facilitates the extraction and/or loading of embedded components.

### The Bundler

#### Bundling Tool

The bundler is a tool that embeds the managed app and its dependencies into the native `AppHost` executable. The functional details of the bundler are explained in [this document](bundler.md). 

#### Build System Interface

Publishing to a single file can be triggered by adding the following property to an application's project file:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PublishSingleFile>true</PublishSingleFile>
</PropertyGroup>    
```

* The `PublishSingleFile` property applies to both framework dependent and self-contained publish operations.
* The `PublishSingleFile` property applies to platform-specific builds with respect to a given runtime-identifier. The output of the build is a native binary for the specified platform.
  When `PublishSingleFile`  is set to `true`, it is an error to leave `RuntimeIdentifier` undefined, or to set `UseAppHost` to `false`.
* Setting the `PublishSingleFile`property causes the managed app, managed dependencies, platform-specific native dependencies, configurations, etc. (basically the contents of the publish directory when `dotnet publish` is run without setting the property) to be embedded within the native `apphost`. 

By default, the symbol files are not embedded within the single-file, but remain as separate files in the publish directory. 
This includes both the IL `.pdb` file, and the native `.ni.pdb` / `app.guid.map` files generated by ready-to-run compiler.
Setting the following property causes the symbol files to be included in the single-file.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <IncludeSymbolsInSingleFile>true</IncludeSymbolsInSingleFile>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Certain files can be explicitly excluded from being embedded in the single-file by setting following meta-data:

```xml
<ExcludeFromSingleFile>true</ExcludeFromSingleFile>
```

For example, to place some files in the publish directory but not bundle them in the single-file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <Content Update="*.xml">
      <CopyToPublishDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToPublishDirectory>
      <ExcludeFromSingleFile>true</ExcludeFromSingleFile>
    </Content>
  </ItemGroup>
```

#### Interaction with other tools

Once the single-file-publish tooling is added to the publish pipeline, other static binary transformation tools may need to adapt its presence. For example:

* The MSBuild logic in `dotnet SDK` should be crafted such that [IlLinker](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/samples/linker-instructions.md), [crossgen](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/building/crossgen.md), and the single-file bundler run in that order in the build/publish sequence. 
* External tools like [Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Fody) that use  `AfterBuild`/`AfterPublish` targets may need to adapt to expect the significantly different output generated by publishing to a single file. The goal in this case is to provide sufficient documentation and guidance.

### The Host

On Startup, the AppHost checks if it has embedded files. If so, it 

* Memory maps the entire bundle file.
* Extracts the necessary files (ex: native binaries) to disk (if any) as explained in this [document](extract.md). 
* Sets up data-structures so other components can access files embedded directly, as explained in this [document](direct.md)

#### Dependency Resolution

An app may choose to only embed some files (ex: due to licensing restrictions) and expect to pickup other dependencies from application-launch directory, nuget packages, etc. In order to resolve assemblies and native libraries, the embedded resources are probed first, followed by other probing paths. 

### New API

In this section, we propose adding a few APIs to facilitate common operations on bundled-apps.

The binaries that are published in the project are expected to be handled transparently by the host. However, explicit access to the embedded files is useful in situations such as:

- Reading additional files packaged into the app (ex: data files).
- Open an assembly for reflection/inspection
- Load plugins built as single-file class-libs using existing Loader APIs.

Therefore, we propose adding an API similar to [GetManifestResourceStream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.assembly.getmanifestresourcestream?view=netframework-4.7.2#System_Reflection_Assembly_GetManifestResourceStream_System_String_) to obtain a stream corresponding to an embedded file. 

This is only a draft of the proposed APIs. The actual shape of the APIs will be decided via API review process.

```cs
namespace System.Runtime.Loader
{
    public partial class Bundle
    {
        // Check whether an app is running from a single-file bundle
        public static bool IsBundle(Assembly assembly);
        
        // Get the location where contents of the bundle are extracted
        public static string GetContentRoot(Assembly assembly);
 
        // Open a file embedded in the bundle built for the specified assembly 
        public static System.IO.Stream GetFileStream(Assembly assembly, string name);
    }
}
```

We can also provide an abstraction that abstracts away the physical location of a file (bundle or disk). For example, add a variant of  `GetFileStream` API that looks for a file in the bundle, and if not found, falls back to disk-lookup. However such abstractions are also easy to build outside of the .Net Framework.

### Existing API

We need to determine the semantics of current APIs such as `Assembly.Location` that return the information about an assembly's location on disk. 

#### `Assembly.Location`

There are a few options to consider for the `Assembly.Location`  property of a bundled assembly:

* A fixed literal (ex: `null`) indicating that no actual location is available.
* The simple name of the assembly (with no path).
* A special UNC notation such as `<bundle-path>/:/asm.dll` to denote files that come from the bundle. 
* The path of the assembly as if it were not to be packaged into the single-file.
* In the case of files spilled to disk (ex: ready-to-run assemblies) -- the actual location of the extracted file.
* A configurable selection of the above, etc.

We propose keeping the default behavior of `Assembly.Location`. That is, 

* If the assembly is loaded directly from the bundle, return empty-string
* If the assembly is extracted to disk, return the location of the extracted file.

Most of the app development can be agnostic to whether the app is published as single-file or not. However, the parts of the app that deal with physical locations of files need to be aware of the single-file packaging. 

#### `AppContext.BaseDirectory`

A few options to consider for the `AppContext.BaseDirectory` are:

* The directory where embedded files are extracted out: This option enables easy access to content files spilled to disk. However, if no files need to be extracted to disk for an application bundle, there's no extraction directory. 
* The extraction-directory if files are extracted, the AppHost directory otherwise. The limitation to this approach is that the value of  `AppContext.BaseDirectory`  changes with the way applications are packaged/executed.
* The directory where `AppHost` binary resides (always).

We propose that `AppContext.BaseDirectory`  should always be set to the directory where the `AppHost` bundle resides.  This scheme doesn't provide an obvious mechanism to access the contents of the extraction directory -- by design. The recommended method for accessing content files from the bundle are: 

- Do not bundle application data files into the single-exe; instead them next to the bundle. This way, the application binary is a single-file, but not the whole application.
- Embed data files as managed resources into application binary, and access them via resource management [APIs](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.assembly.getmanifestresourcestream?view=netcore-3.0>). 

## Testing

* Unit Tests to achieve good coverage on apps using managed, ready-to-run, native code 
* Tests for the newly added API 
* Tests to verify that framework-dependent and self-contained apps can be published as single file.
* Tests for ensure that every app model template supported by .NET Core (console, wpf, winforms, web, etc.) can be published as a single file.
* A subset of CoreCLR Tests
* Tests to ensure that MSIL files with embedded PDBs are handled correctly
* End-to-End testing on real world apps

#### Measurements

Measure publish size and run-time (first run, subsequent runs) for HelloWorld (framework-dependent and self-contained), Roslyn and MusicStore.

#### Telemetry

Collect telemetry for single-file published apps with respect to parameters such as:

* Framework-dependent vs self-contained apps.
* Whether the apps are Pure managed apps, ready-to run compiled apps, or have native dependencies.
* Embedding of additional/data files, and use of file access API.

## Further Work

#### Bundler Optimizations

Since all the files of an app published as a single-file live together, we can perform the following optimizations

- R2R compile the app and all of its dependent assemblies in a single version-bubble

  Single-file apps compiled cross-platform may have this optimization disabled until the ready-to-run compiler  (`crossgen`) supports cross-compilation. 

- Investigate whether collectively signing the files in an assembly saves space for certificates.

#### Compression

Currently the bundler does not compress the contents embedded at the end of the host binary. 
Compressing the bundled files and meta-data can significantly reduce the size of the single-file output (by about 30%-50% as determined by prototyping).

#### Single-file Plugins

The above design should be extended to seamlessly support single-file publish for plugins.

- The bundler tool will mostly work as-is, regardless of whether we publish an application or class-lib. The binary blob with dependencies can be appended to both native and managed binaries.
- For host/runtime support, the options are:
  - Implement plugins using existing infrastructure. For example: Take control of assembly/native binary loads via existing `AssemblyLoadContext` callbacks and events. Extract the files embedded within the single-file plugin using the `GetFileStream()` API and load them on demand.
  - Have new API to load a single-file plugin, for example: `AssemblyLoadContext.LoadWithEmbeddedDependencies()`.

#### VS Integration

Developers should be able to use the feature easily from Visual Studio. The feature will start with text based support -- by explicitly setting the `PublishSingleFile` property in the project file. In future, we may provide a single-file publish-profile, or other UI triggers.

## User Experience

To summarize, here's the overall experience for creating a HelloWorld single-file app 

*  Create a new HelloWorld app: `HelloWorld$ dotnet new console`

#### Framework Dependent HelloWorld

* Normal publish: `dotnet publish` 

  * Publish directory contains the host `HelloWorld.exe` ,  the app `HelloWorld.dll`, configuration files `HelloWorld.deps.json`, `HelloWorld.runtimeconfig.json`, and the PDB-file `HelloWorld.pdb`.

* Single-file publish: `dotnet publish -r win10-x64 --self-contained=false /p:PublishSingleFile=true`

  * Publish directory contains: `HelloWorld.exe` `HelloWorld.pdb`

  * `HelloWorld.dll`, `HelloWorld.deps.json`, and `HelloWorld.runtimeconfig.json` are embedded within `HelloWorld.exe`.

* Run: `HelloWorld.exe`

  * The app runs completely from the single-file, without the need for intermediate extraction to file.

#### Self-Contained HelloWorld

- Normal publish: `dotnet publish -r win10-x64`

  * Publish directory contains 221 files including the host, the app, configuration files, the PDB-file and the runtime.

- Single-file publish: `dotnet publish -r win10-x64 /p:PublishSingleFile=true`

  - Publish directory contains: `HelloWorld.exe` `HelloWorld.pdb`
  - The remaining 219 files are embedded within the host `HelloWorld.exe`.

- Run: `HelloWorld.exe`

  * The bundled app and configuration files are processed directly from the bundle.
  * Remaining 216 files will be extracted to disk at startup. 
  * If reuse of extracted files is enabled, subsequent runs of the app may skip the extraction step.


Most applications are expected to work without any changes. However, apps with a strong expectation about absolute location of dependent files may need to be made aware of bundling and extraction aspects of single-file publishing. No difference is expected with respect to debugging and analysis of apps.

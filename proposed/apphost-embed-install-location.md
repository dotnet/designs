# Add ability to embed install location options in apphost

There have been numerous requests around being able to customize how/where the
.NET root path will be determined for an application. This document describes
a proposed mechanism for basic configuration of how `apphost` will search for
the .NET install location.

Goals:

- Enable developers to build an app and configure it such that it can:
    - Only consider global .NET installs
    - Always look at a relative path for a .NET install
- Create a building block for a fuller, SDK-supported experience that should fit
in regardless of where we land for the full experience

Non-goals:

- SDK support for layout and deployment of the app with a runtime files in a
corresponding relative path
- SDK and project system experience for building a set of applications using the
same custom runtime install location

## State in .NET 8

The current state is described in detail in
[install-locations](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2020/install-locations.md)
and [install-locations-per-architecture](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2021/install-locations-per-architecture.md)

At a high level, the process and priority for `apphost` determining the install
location is:

  1. App-local
      - Look for the runtime in the app's folder (self-contained apps)
  2. Environment variables
      - Read the `DOTNET_ROOT_<arch>` and `DOTNET_ROOT` environment variables
  3. Global install (registered)
      - Check for a registered install - registry key on Windows or an install
      location file on non-Windows
  4. Global install (default)
      - Fall back to a well-known default install location based on the platform

## Embedded install location options for `apphost`

Every `apphost` already has a placeholder that gets rewritten to contain the app
binary path during build (that is, `dotnet build`). This proposal adds another
placeholder which would represent the optional configuration of search locations
and app-relative path to an install location. Same as existing placeholder, it
would conditionally be rewritten based on the app's settings. This rewrite would
[only be done on `publish`](#writing-options-on-publish) of the app currently.
This is similar to the proposal in [dotnet/runtime#64430](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/64430),
but with additional configuration of which search locations to use.

### Configuration of search locations

Some applications do not want to use all the default search locations when they
are deployed - for example, [dotnet/runtime#86801](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/86801).

We can allow selection of which search locations the `apphost` will use. When
search locations are configured, only the specified locations will be searched.

The search location could be specified via a property in the project:

```xml
<AppHostDotNetSearch>Global</AppHostDotNetSearch>
```

where the valid values are `AppLocal`, `AppRelative`, `EnvironmentVariables`, or
`Global`. Multiple values can be specified, delimited by semi-colons.

When a value is specified, only those locations will be used. For example, if
`Global` is specified, `apphost` will only look at global install locations, not
app-local, at any app-relative path, or at environment variables.

### App-relative path to install location

When a relative path is written into an `apphost` which is [configured to look
at it](#configuration-of-search-locations), that path will be used as the .NET
install root when running the application.

The install location could be specified via a property in the project:

```xml
<AppHostRelativeDotNet>./relative/path/to/runtime</AppHostRelativeDotNet>
```

Setting this implies `AppHostDotNetSearch=AppRelative`. This means that only the
relative path will be considered. If a .NET install is not found at the relative
path, other locations - environment variables, global install locations - will
not be considered and the app will fail to run.

`AppHostDotNetSearch` could also be explicitly set to include a fallback - for
example, `AppHostDotNetSearch=AppRelative;Global` would look at the relative
path and, if it is not found, the global locations. If `AppHostDotNetSearch` is
explicitly set to a value that does not include `AppRelative`, then setting
`AppHostRelativeDotNet` is meaningless - the SDK will not write the relative
path into the `apphost` and the `apphost` will not check for a relative path.

The path must not be rooted and will be written into the `apphost` unmodified.
At run time, the path will be considered relative to the app location - that is,
it is appended to the location of the `apphost` itself. The app relies on file
system APIs of the underlying OS to determine if the path is valid and exists.

When running `C:\dir\app.exe` or `/home/dir/app` with `AppHostRelativeDotNet` set to:
  - `my_dotnet`: the app will look at `C:\dir\my_dotnet` or `/home/dir/my_dotnet`
  - `./my_dotnet`: the app will look at `C:\dir\my_dotnet` or `/home/dir/my_dotnet`
  - `../my_dotnet` the app will look at `C:\my_dotnet` or `/home/my_dotnet`

## Updated behaviour

At a high level, the updated process and priority for `apphost` determining the
install location would be:

  1. App-local, if search location not configured
      - Look for the runtime in the app's folder (self-contained apps)
  2. App-relative, if specified as a search location
      - Use the path written into `apphost`, relative to the app location
  3. Environment variables, if search location not configured or if set as a
  search location
      - Read the `DOTNET_ROOT_<arch>` and `DOTNET_ROOT` environment variables
  4. Global install (registered), if search location not configured or if set as
  a search location
      - Check for a registered install - registry key on Windows or a install
      location file on non-Windows
  5. Global install (default), if search location not configured or if set as a
  search location
      - Fall back to a well-known default install location based on the platform

By default - that is, without any configured install location options - the
effective behaviour remains as in the [current state](#state-in-net-8).

## Considerations

### Writing options on publish

This proposal writes the install location options in the `apphost` on `publish`.
Without SDK support for constructing the layout, updating on `build` would cause
the app to stop working in inner dev loop scenarios (running from output folder,
`dotnet run`, F5) unless they create a layout with the runtime in the expected
location relative to the app output as part of their build. This introduces a
difference  between `build` and `publish` for `apphost` (currently, it is the
same between `build` and `publish` - with the exception of single-file, which is
only a `publish` scenario), but once SDK support is added it can be reconciled.

### Other hosts

This proposal is only for `apphost`. It is not relevant for `singlefilehost`, as
that has the runtime itself statically linked. Other hosts (`comhost`, `ijwhost`)
are also not included. In theory, other hosts could be given the same treatment,
but we do not have feedback for scenarios using them. They also do not have the
app-local search or the existing requirement of being partially re-written via a
known placeholder. Changing them would add significant complexity without a
compelling scenario. If we see confusion here, we could add an SDK warning if
`AppHostRelativeDotNet` or `AppHostDotNetSearch` is set for those projects.

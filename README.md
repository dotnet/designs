## Creating a proposal

Unless you're driving the design of a feature, you're not expected to contribute
to this repo. Specifically, if you merely want to request new features, you
should file an issue for the [corresponding repo](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/core-repos.md).

To create a proposal:

1. Create a new branch off of `main`
2. Create a document in the `accepted` folder and use [meta/template.md](meta/template.md) as your
   starting point.
3. Create a pull request against `main`
4. Once broad agreement is reached, merge the PR
